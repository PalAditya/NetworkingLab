First run random.c to create the text file.
Then start four servers on ports 8080,8081,8082 and 8083. (Same code as in server.c; it accepts port numbers)
Call clientV2.c to get the answer (client.c works only for 1000 numbers as it is hardcoded)
Assumption: At least four numbers are present in random.txt
